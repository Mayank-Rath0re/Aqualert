Conus marmoreus, common name the "marbled cone", is a species of predatory sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails, cone shells or cones.
Cone snails have a large variety of shell colors and patterns, with local varieties and color forms of the same species often occurring. 
Cone snails are prized for their brightly colored and patterned shells, which may tempt people to pick them up.
All cone snails are venomous and capable of stinging. Cone snails use a modified radula tooth and a venom gland to attack and paralyze their prey before engulfing it.
