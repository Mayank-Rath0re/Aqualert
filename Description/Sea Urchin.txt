Sea urchins are spiny, globular echinoderms in the class Echinoidea. About 950 species of sea urchin live on the seabed of every ocean and inhabit every depth zone
from the intertidal seashore down to 5,000 meters (16,000 ft; 2,700 fathoms).
Sea urchin injuries are puncture wounds inflicted by the animal's brittle, fragile spines.
These are a common source of injury to ocean swimmers, especially along coastal surfaces where coral with stationary sea urchins are present. 
Their stings vary in severity depending on the species. Their spines can be venomous or cause infection.
They inflict a painful wound when they penetrate human skin, but are not themselves dangerous if fully removed promptly; if left in the skin, further problems may occur.
