A barracuda is a large, predatory, ray-finned fish known for its fearsome appearance and ferocious behaviour.
Barracuda are snake-like in appearance, with prominent, sharp-edged, fang-like teeth, much like piranha, all of different sizes, set in sockets of their large jaws.
They have large, pointed heads with an underbite in many species. Their gill covers have no spines and are covered with small scales.
