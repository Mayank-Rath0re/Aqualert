Piranha, also called caribe or piraya, any of more than 60 species of razor-toothed carnivorous fish of South American rivers and lakes, with a somewhat exaggerated reputation for ferocity.

Although often described as extremely dangerous in the media, piranhas typically do not represent a serious risk to humans.
However, attacks have occurred, especially when the piranhas are in a stressed situation such as the dense groups that may occur
when the water is lower during the dry season and food is relatively scarce.

Swimming near fishermen may increase the risk of attacks due to the commotion caused by struggling fish and the presence of bait in the water.

Splashing attracts piranhas and for this reason children are more often attacked than adults.
