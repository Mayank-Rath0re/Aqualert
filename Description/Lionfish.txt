Pterois is a genus of venomous marine fish, commonly known as lionfish, native to the Indo-Pacific.
It is characterized by conspicuous warning coloration with red or black bands, and ostentatious dorsal fins tipped with venomous spines.

Lionfish are known for their venomous fin rays, which makes them hazardous to other marine animals, as well as humans.

Pterois venom can cause systemic effects such as pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, headache, numbness, paresthesia, diarrhea, sweating,
temporary paralysis of the limbs, respiratory insufficiency, heart failure, convulsions, and even death. 
Fatalities are more common in very young children, the elderly, or those who are allergic to the venom.
