Toxopneustes pileolus, commonly known as the flower urchin, is a widespread and commonly encountered species of sea urchin from the Indo-West Pacific. 
It is considered highly dangerous, as it is capable of delivering extremely painful and medically significant stings when touched. 
Nevertheless, flower urchins are still considered highly dangerous. 
The severe debilitating pain of the flower urchin sting compounded by muscular paralysis, breathing problems, numbness, and disorientation can result in accidental drowning among divers and swimmers.
