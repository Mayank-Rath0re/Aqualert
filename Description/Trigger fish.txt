Triggerfish are about 40 species of often brightly colored fish of the family Balistidae. 
Often marked by lines and spots, they inhabit tropical and subtropical oceans throughout the world, with the greatest species richness in the Indo-Pacific. 
Most are found in relatively shallow, coastal habitats.
Some triggerfish species can be quite aggressive when guarding their eggs.
Unlike the relatively small picasso triggerfish, the titan triggerfish poses a serious threat to inattentive divers due to its large size and powerful teeth.
