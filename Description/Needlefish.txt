Needlefish are slender, ranging from 3.0 to 95 cm (1.2 to 37.4 in) in length.
They have a single dorsal fin, placed far back on the body, almost opposite to the anal fin.
Their most distinctive feature is their long, narrow beak, which bears multiple sharp teeth.
Needlefish, like all ray-finned beloniforms, are capable of making short jumps out of the water at up to 60 km/h (37 mph).
Since needlefish swim near the surface, they often leap over the decks of shallow boats rather than going around.
This jumping activity is greatly excited by artificial light at night; night fisherman and divers in areas across 
the Pacific Ocean have been "attacked" by schools of suddenly excited needlefish diving across the water 
towards the light source at high speed. Their sharp beaks are capable of inflicting deep puncture wounds.
