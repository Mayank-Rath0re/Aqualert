The great white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), also known as the white shark, white pointer, or simply great white,
is a species of large mackerel shark which can be found in the coastal surface waters of all the major oceans.

The great white shark has a robust, large, conical snout. The upper and lower lobes on the tail fin are approximately the same size which is similar to some mackerel sharks.

Of all shark species, the great white shark is responsible for by far the largest number of recorded shark bite incidents on humans, with 272 documented unprovoked bite incidents on humans as of 2012.
