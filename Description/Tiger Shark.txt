The tiger shark is a solitary, mostly nocturnal hunter.
It is notable for having the widest food spectrum of all sharks, with a range
of prey that includes crustaceans, fish, seals, birds, squid, turtles, sea snakes, dolphins, and even other, smaller sharks. 

Although sharks rarely bite humans, the tiger shark is reported to be responsible for a large share of fatal shark-bite incidents,
and is regarded as one of the most dangerous shark species. They often visit shallow reefs, harbors, and canals, creating the potential for encounter with humans.

While it ranks second on the list of number of recorded shark attacks on humans, behind only the great white shark, such attacks are few and very seldom fatal.
